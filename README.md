# Matching Pairs

Matching Pairs is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn , The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards
there is a score counter and a wins counter 
the images on the back side of the cards are pictures from my home 
because it is a funny idea that motivates me to code more LoL
